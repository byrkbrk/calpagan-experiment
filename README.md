# CALPAGAN: CALorimetry for PArticles using Generative Adversarial Networks

This repository contains one of the experiments carried out for the work "CALPAGAN" (presented in the conference [YEFIST](http://www.yefist.org/), on  September 25, 2022).

As a model, we use the conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) Pix2pix proposed in the article [Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004).

## Requierements

This repository is prepared to train the model entirely on Google Colab. That means, to train the model and generate the images without any issue, it is sufficient to

- open the notebook `calpagan_train.ipynb` on Google Colab (using the [link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/byrkbrk/calpagan-experiment/blob/main/calpagan_train.ipynb) or the link *Open in Colab* inside the notebook)
- log in your Google account (if you haven't yet)
- run the (self-explanatory) notebook cells one by by
